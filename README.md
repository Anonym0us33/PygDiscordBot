-bot will now say your display name and not your username

-i modified the endpoint and conversation history to use langchain and soon i will add oobabooga support. i just need to add a line to detect what api you put as the endpoint. (ADDED)

# More Information

- DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN: Obtain this token from the Discord Developer Portal. [Guide for setting that up](https://rentry.org/discordbotguide)
- ENDPOINT: Set the endpoint variable with the KoboldAI URL obtained from this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/koboldai/KoboldAI-Client/blob/main/colab/GPU.ipynb). Simply press Shift + Enter to run the cells until you acquire the API URL. Alternatively, if you have a powerful GPU, you can run Kobold locally using [Kobold](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client) or its [Kobold 4bit fork](https://github.com/0cc4m/KoboldAI).
  For more information on running it locally, refer to: [Local Installation (GPU)](https://docs.alpindale.dev/local-installation-(gpu)/kobold/)

# Slash Commands

Currently, these commands are primarily useful for developers. If you don't see them, use the `/sync` command to force their appearance.

| Command Name          | Slash Command   | More Info                                                      |
|-----------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Sync Commands         | `/sync`         | Forces the slash commands to appear immediately.               |
| Reload Cog            | `/reload <name>`| Reloads a specific cog instead of restarting everything.       |
| Regenerate Last Message| `/regenerate`   | Removes the last message and generates another one.             |
