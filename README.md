# Discord Tavern Style Pygmalion Chatbot
This is a discord bot that uses Pygmalion-6B and a KoboldAI url. The bot uses the name that you choose for it in the developer portal and the persona you set in the .env file. I plan on adding more features like group chat support, random messages, and the ability to comment on images you share.
