# Python Pygmalion Chatbot Starter Project
This is a bare bones example of python being used with Pygmalion and a Tavern style character prompt. Feel free to improve this or use it as a starting point in your projects. I would love to collaborate with people.

Set the endpoint variable with the KoboldAI url you get from this [google collab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZvYq4GmjfsyIkcTQcrBhSFXs8vQLLMAS):
```python
# put KoboldAI url https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZvYq4GmjfsyIkcTQcrBhSFXs8vQLLMAS
endpoint = "https://bridges-example.trycloudflare.com/"
```
look for this url in the google collab output:
